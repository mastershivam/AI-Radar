<p>Blog Post Title: Fast LoRA inference for Flux with Diffusers and PEFT
Date Published: 2025-07-23
URL: https://huggingface.co/blog/lora-fast
 The blog post titled "Fast LoRa Inference for Flax with Diffusers and PEFT" discusses the implementation of Large Optimal Robustly-pruned Affine transformations (LoRa) for efficient inference on the Flax framework. It details how Diffusers, a library for training and deploying diffusion models, and PEFT (Partial Evolutionary Fine-tuning Transformers), an approach to fine-tune large models more efficiently, are combined with LoRa to significantly reduce model size while maintaining performance, making it suitable for deployment on resource-constrained devices.</p>
