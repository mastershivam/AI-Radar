 The blog post titled "TimeScope: How Long Can Your Video Large Multimodal Model Go?" on Hugging Face's blog discusses the new benchmark, TimeScope, designed to evaluate the performance of large multimodal models on long video clips. The authors introduce TimeScope and demonstrate its use with several state-of-the-art multimodal models like LM-Diffusers and BigSleep, evaluating their ability to handle long videos for tasks such as video retrieval and action recognition.

 The blog post titled "Fast LoRa Inference for Flax with Diffusers and PEFT" discusses the implementation of Large Optimal Robustly-pruned Affine transformations (LoRa) for efficient inference on the Flax framework. It details how Diffusers, a library for training and deploying diffusion models, and PEFT (Partial Evolutionary Fine-tuning Transformers), an approach to fine-tune large models more efficiently, are combined with LoRa to significantly reduce model size while maintaining performance, making it suitable for deployment on resource-constrained devices.
