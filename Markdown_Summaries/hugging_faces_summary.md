The article covers beam search, nucleus sampling, and top-p sampling as the primary decoding methods, explaining their workings and applications, and providing code examples in Python. It emphasizes that selecting the appropriate decoding method depends on the specific use case requirements such as diversity, fluency, and speed of text generation.
